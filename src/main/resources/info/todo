- change quizSelection error handling from sout to alert box

- refactor variable names. Use of question(class), query, question string,
  etc. overlap. Choose better name to use throughout app and db for
  easier readability

- add comments to everything, help to understand the flow

- check classes to look for optimization




***************************************************
                       DONE
***************************************************

- handle input errors from quizSelection page. Currently you can type
  anything in. Needs to be able to accept 1 - size of db and correctly
  handle everything else.
