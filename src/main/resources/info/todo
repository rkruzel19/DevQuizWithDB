    - Minor stuffs out of the way, time to do some real coding
    - Implement tag/category to a question
    - Goal is for the Quiz Selection page to display all available categories for user to pick from
        - can pick multiple
        - amount of Q's in category displayed
        - can then select All questions or a # in the range of all clicked categories sum of questions
            - if a # in range is chosen, a random amount of Q's from each category should be given
    - Categories:
        - Java, JS, React, Angluar, Node, General, HTML, CSS (to start)
        - Use enums and give the users only options from the enums class to choose as a category
            - Means for now users can't add new categories, just has to be added to enums in the code
